# Shifting Suspensions in Illinois

March 22, 2021

The Transit Table Coalition, obtained zip-code level data from the Illinois Secretary of State showing where drivers are suspended for various reasons. I worked with the Chicago Jobs Council to analyze this data. We analyzed the relationship between suspensions/holds and race, poverty, and employment. For these comparisons we used the number or suspensions/holds in each zip code, the suspension rate or suspensions per capita in each zip code, and the number of suspensions per person in each zip code.

Demographics data is from the ACS 2019 5-year survey.

Our report can be found at TBD.

## Data location
The suspension data can be downloaded from the bottom of our report webpage. The scripts expect to find both of the suspensions data folders in their directory. The census data is included in this repo in the "census_data" folder.

## Dependencies
Numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pandas.
